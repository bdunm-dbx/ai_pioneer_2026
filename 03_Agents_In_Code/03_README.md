# Informational: Building Agent Systems In Code with Databricks

This lab focuses on low-code options to build Agents on Databricks which provide an accelerated path to production. Databricks absolutely supports and has a wide ecosystem for code-first approaches covering popular framework and Databricks-specific libraries along with MLflow (https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/mlflow3/genai/). 

Please don't hesitate to reach out to your Databricks account team or the proctors of the in-person training to understand common patterns to build agents in code, helpful accelerators, and demos. While this specific lab does not provide any hands-on activities, the below reference information is a great place to start if you think a use case would benefit from custom agents in code:
