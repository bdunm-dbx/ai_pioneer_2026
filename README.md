# Databricks AI Pioneer Workshops - 2026
This is a public repository for the Databricks AI Pioneer workshop containing code and instruction content to learn about the Databricks Agent Bricks AI & Machine Learning platform. 

Start by cloning this repo to your Databricks workspace. If you are not attending a proctored workshop, use the 00_Setup notebooks and data to prepare your envirionment. If you are at a proctored workshop, this has already been done in the environment. You may need to adjust catalog/schema names. These exercises are designed to work on both Serverless and Classic workspaces.
