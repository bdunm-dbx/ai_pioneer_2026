Hello,

I just bought an iPad Air with cellular and I want to add it to my account. What are my options and how much does it cost?

I already have an Unlimited Plus phone line with you.

Hi Laura,

Great choice on the iPad Air! We have several tablet data plan options:

OPTION 1: Tablet Line with Unlimited Data - $20/month
- Unlimited data for your iPad
- Shares your phone number for iMessage/FaceTime
- 5G access included
- No contract

OPTION 2: Shared Data from Phone Plan
- Use your phone's hotspot to connect iPad
- No additional monthly fee
- Uses your phone's 30GB hotspot allotment
- Requires phone to be nearby

OPTION 3: Standalone Tablet Plan (if separate from phone account)
- 15GB data: $35/month
- 30GB data: $50/month
- Unlimited: $70/month

BEST VALUE FOR YOU:
Since you already have Unlimited Plus with 30GB hotspot, you have two great choices:

A) Add tablet line for $20/month - convenience of independent connection
B) Use your phone's hotspot - $0/month but requires phone nearby

Most customers in your situation choose Option A ($20/month) because:
- iPad works anywhere, independently
- Doesn't drain phone battery
- Dedicated data connection
- Same phone number for iMessage

Want to add the tablet line?

Best,
Thomas Lee

Thomas,

The $20/month option sounds perfect. Let's do that!

How do I activate the iPad?

Done! I've added the tablet line to your account.

TO ACTIVATE YOUR iPAD:
1. Go to Settings > Cellular Data
2. Tap "Set Up Cellular"
3. Select our carrier name
4. Follow the prompts to activate

If you have any issues, your iPad should show a prompt automatically when you first connect. Just follow the on-screen instructions.

Your iPad will use the same number as your iPhone for iMessage and FaceTime. For cellular data identification, it has its own number: 555-4938.

The $20/month charge starts today and will appear on your December 15th bill.

Enjoy your new iPad!

Thomas
