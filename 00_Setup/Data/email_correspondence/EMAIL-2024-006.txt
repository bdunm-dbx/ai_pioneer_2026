Subject: Autopay Failed - Payment Method Update

Hello,

I just got a notification that my autopay failed and my service will be suspended in 48 hours if I don't pay. This doesn't make sense - I have plenty of money in my checking account and autopay has been working fine for 2 years.

Can you please check what's going on? I don't want my service cut off.

Dear Kevin,

Thank you for reaching out about your autopay issue. I've investigated your account and found the problem.

Your autopay was using a debit card ending in 4892, which our system shows was declined on November 20th with the reason "Card Expired." It appears your bank issued you a new card with a new expiration date, and the old card was deactivated.

This is very common - banks typically reissue cards every 3 years for security.

GOOD NEWS: I've suspended the service suspension notice, so you have time to update your payment method without any interruption.

TO UPDATE YOUR PAYMENT:
1. Log in to your account at telecom.com
2. Go to Billing > Payment Methods
3. Update your card information with the new expiration date (or add your new card)
4. Your autopay will resume automatically

Alternatively, I can update this over the phone if you prefer - just call us at 1-800-555-0100.

Your next payment of $75 will process on November 28th. As long as you update by then, everything will continue normally.

Best regards,
Amanda Porter

Amanda,

That makes total sense! I did get a new card last month and forgot to update it. I just logged in and updated the expiration date. Thanks for catching this before my service got shut off!

Kevin
