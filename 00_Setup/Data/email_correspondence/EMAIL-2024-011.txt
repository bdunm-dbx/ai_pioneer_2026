Hi,

I've had my iPhone 13 for about 18 months now (since May 2023). I'm interested in upgrading to the iPhone 15 Pro, but I'm still making payments on my current phone. Do you have any early upgrade options?

My battery life has gotten terrible and I really could use a new phone.

Thanks,
Ashley Kim

Hi Ashley,

Great news! I've checked your account and you are eligible for an early upgrade.

CURRENT DEVICE STATUS:
- iPhone 13 (128GB)
- Original Price: $799
- Paid so far: $449.50 (18 of 24 payments)
- Remaining balance: $349.50

EARLY UPGRADE OPTIONS:

**Option 1: Trade-In Upgrade**
- Trade in your iPhone 13 (estimated value: $300)
- We pay off your remaining $349.50 balance
- You start fresh with iPhone 15 Pro at $999
- Net cost to you: $1,048.50 over 24 months ($43.69/month)

**Option 2: Keep & Pay Off**
- Pay off the $349.50 balance now
- Trade in iPhone 13 for $300 credit toward iPhone 15 Pro
- Finance iPhone 15 Pro: $699 over 24 months ($29.13/month)

**Option 3: Standard Upgrade**
- Continue paying iPhone 13 ($33.29/month)
- Add iPhone 15 Pro payments ($41.63/month)
- Total: $74.92/month for 6 months, then $41.63/month
- You keep both phones or sell the iPhone 13 yourself

RECOMMENDATION:
Option 2 gives you the lowest monthly payment if you can pay the $349.50 now. Option 1 is easiest with no upfront cost.

We also have a Black Friday promotion this weekend - $100 extra trade-in bonus! If you can wait a few days, you'd get $400 for your iPhone 13 instead of $300.

Ready to upgrade? Reply here or visit your nearest store!

Chris,

This is super helpful! I think I'll wait for the Black Friday deal and do Option 1 with the trade-in. That extra $100 makes a big difference!

Can I do this online or should I go to a store?

Hi Ashley,

Smart choice! You can do this either way:

ONLINE: Visit telecom.com/upgrade starting Friday (Nov 29th). The trade-in process includes a prepaid shipping label.

IN-STORE: Any of our retail locations. They can do the trade-in assessment on the spot and you walk out with your new phone.

I'll send you a reminder email on Friday morning when the Black Friday deals go live!

Chris
