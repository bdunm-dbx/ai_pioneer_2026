Thanks,
Rachel Thompson

Dear Rachel,

Thank you for contacting us about unlocking your iPhone 12. Great news - I've reviewed your account and confirmed that your device meets all our unlocking requirements:

✓ Device is fully paid off
✓ Account is in good standing
✓ Device has been active for more than 40 days
✓ No pending insurance claims

Your unlock request has been APPROVED and processed. Your iPhone 12 (IMEI: 356892041234567) will be unlocked within 24-48 hours.

**What happens next:**
1. You'll receive a confirmation email when the unlock is complete (usually within 24 hours)
2. Connect your iPhone to iTunes/Finder or perform a network settings reset
3. Your phone will then work with any compatible carrier's SIM card

**To confirm the unlock:**
- Go to Settings > General > About
- Look for "Carrier Lock" - it should say "No SIM restrictions"

If you have any issues after 48 hours, please reply to this email and we'll investigate further.

Enjoy your travels!

Best regards,
Michael Rodriguez

Michael,

Perfect! I just checked and it shows "No SIM restrictions" now. That was fast - thank you so much!
