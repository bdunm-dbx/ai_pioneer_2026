Hi, I want to trade in my Samsung Galaxy S22 for a new iPhone 15. What's the trade-in value? The phone is in excellent condition - no scratches, works perfectly.

Hi Emily,

Great question! Based on the information you provided, your Samsung Galaxy S22 in excellent condition has an estimated trade-in value of $350.

Here's how the trade-in process works:
1. Order your new iPhone 15
2. We'll email you a prepaid shipping label
3. Ship your S22 to us within 14 days
4. We'll inspect it and confirm the $350 value
5. Credit applied as $14.58/month for 24 months

The iPhone 15 (128GB) is $799. With your $350 trade-in, you'd finance $449 at $18.71/month for 24 months.

Best,
