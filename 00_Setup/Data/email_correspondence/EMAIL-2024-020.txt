I forgot my account PIN and need to reset it. I tried calling customer service but the automated system kept asking for my PIN, which I don't remember!

Can you help me reset it via email?

Hi Michelle,

I can help you reset your account PIN. For security purposes, I need to verify your identity first.

SECURITY VERIFICATION:
Please confirm the following information:
1. Full name on the account
2. Billing address
3. Last 4 digits of the payment method on file
4. Date of birth

Once verified, I'll send you a secure link to reset your PIN.

(Note: We cannot reset PINs via email without identity verification - this protects your account security.)

Best regards,
Tyler Johnson

Hi Michelle,

Thank you for that information. I've verified your identity successfully!

I've sent a secure PIN reset link to this email address. The link expires in 2 hours for security.

TO RESET YOUR PIN:
1. Click the link in the email (separate from this one)
2. Create a new 4-digit PIN
3. Confirm the new PIN
4. Done!

NEW PIN REQUIREMENTS:
- 4 digits
- Cannot be 0000, 1111, 2222, etc.
- Cannot be 1234 or other sequential numbers
- Avoid your birth year or address numbers

The new PIN will work immediately for:
- Calling customer service
- Making account changes in-store
- Authorizing porting requests

HELPFUL TIP: Write your PIN down and store it somewhere secure (password manager, safe place at home). Most people forget PINs because they rarely need them!

Is there anything else I can help you with?

Best,
Tyler

Tyler,

Perfect! I reset my PIN and saved it in my password manager this time so I won't forget again.

Thanks for your help!

Michelle
