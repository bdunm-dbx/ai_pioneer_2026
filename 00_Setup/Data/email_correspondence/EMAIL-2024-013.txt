Subject: International Calling Rates to India

Hello,

I call my parents in India (Mumbai) almost daily, usually for about 30 minutes each call. What are your international calling rates to India, and do you have any packages that would save me money?

Currently paying $45 extra each month on my bill for international calls.

Hi Priya,

I'm happy to help you find a better solution for staying in touch with your family!

CURRENT RATES:
India calling: $0.05/minute
Your monthly usage: ~900 minutes (30 min/day x 30 days)
Current cost: $45/month ✓ (This matches your bill)

BETTER OPTIONS FOR YOU:

**Option 1: International Calling Add-On - $15/month**
- Unlimited calls to 70+ countries including India
- Unlimited texting to those countries
- SAVINGS: $30/month ($360/year!)

**Option 2: Unlimited Premium Plan Upgrade**
- Includes calling to 20 countries (India included)
- Also includes unlimited data in Mexico/Canada
- Your plan upgrade: $70 to $85 (+$15/month)
- But you eliminate the $45 in calling charges
- NET SAVINGS: $30/month plus bonus features

**Option 3: Use Wi-Fi Calling + WhatsApp**
- Free option if your parents have WhatsApp and Wi-Fi
- Call over internet instead of cellular
- No charges whatsoever
- Video calling included

RECOMMENDATION:
The International Calling add-on ($15/month) gives you the best value. You'd save $30/month immediately and never worry about per-minute charges again.

Want me to add it to your account?

Amit,

Yes please! Add the International Calling add-on. $15 vs $45 is a no-brainer!

My parents do have WhatsApp, but they're not tech-savvy and prefer regular phone calls. This is perfect.

When does it start?

Done! The International Calling add-on is now active on your account.

You can start calling India immediately at no per-minute charge. The $15/month fee will appear on your December bill.

Quick tip: Even though you have unlimited calling now, Wi-Fi Calling can provide better call quality sometimes. Enable it in your iPhone settings for clearer calls when you're on Wi-Fi at home.

Enjoy unlimited calls to your parents!

Amit
