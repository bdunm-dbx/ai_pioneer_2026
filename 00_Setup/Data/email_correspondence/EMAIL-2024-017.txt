Subject: Voicemail Not Sending Notifications

My iPhone 13 isn't notifying me when I get voicemails. I've missed several important calls because I didn't know anyone left a message.

The voicemails are there when I check manually, but I'm not getting the notification badge or alerts.

Phone: 555-8157

Hi Chris,

This is a common issue with iPhone voicemail notifications, and it's usually a quick fix!

TROUBLESHOOTING STEPS:

Step 1 - Check Notification Settings:
- Settings > Phone > Notifications
- Make sure "Allow Notifications" is ON
- Check that "Badges" is enabled
- Verify sound/banner settings are configured how you want

Step 2 - Reset Voicemail Password:
Sometimes corrupted voicemail settings cause this. Let's reset:
- Dial *611 from your phone
- Say "Reset voicemail password"
- Follow prompts to create new password
- Hang up and wait 2 minutes
- Open Phone app > Voicemail tab

Step 3 - Reset Network Settings (if Steps 1-2 don't work):
- Settings > General > Transfer or Reset iPhone
- Reset > Reset Network Settings
- This won't delete your data, just network configs
- Phone will restart

Try Step 1 first and let me know if that fixes it. If not, we'll move to Step 2.

Best,
Angela Reyes

Angela,

Step 1 worked! The "Allow Notifications" was somehow turned off. I definitely didn't do that intentionally. 

Just tested it - had my coworker call and leave a voicemail, and I got the notification immediately!

Thanks!

Awesome! Glad it was a simple fix.

FYI - Sometimes iOS updates can reset notification preferences, so it's worth checking after every major iPhone update.

Happy to help!
