I experienced a complete service outage for 6 hours yesterday (November 19th, 4 PM - 10 PM) in my area (ZIP 94103). I rely on my phone for work and missed important client calls. I'd like to request compensation for this outage.

Dear Sophia,

Thank you for contacting us about the service outage. I sincerely apologize for the disruption to your service.

I've confirmed that there was indeed a network outage in the 94103 area on November 19th from 4:17 PM to 9:52 PM (5 hours 35 minutes) due to emergency fiber optic cable repairs.

As compensation for this outage, I've applied a $15 credit to your account, representing approximately 7 days of service credit. This will appear on your next bill.

We've also completed the repairs and enhanced redundancy in that area to prevent similar issues.

Best regards,
Marcus Johnson
Network Services Team
