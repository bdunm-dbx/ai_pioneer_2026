Subject: URGENT: Lost Phone - Need Replacement SIM

Hi,

I lost my phone last night (left it in an Uber). I already reported it to the police and Uber, but I need to get a replacement SIM card so I can use my old phone while I figure out what to do.

My number is 555-9273. Can you suspend service on the lost phone and send me a new SIM?

This is urgent as I need my number for work.

Hi Amanda,

I'm sorry to hear about your lost phone! I'm taking immediate action to protect your account.

ACTIONS TAKEN (as of 8:20 AM):
✓ Suspended service on your lost device (prevents unauthorized use)
✓ Your number is protected - no one can make calls or use data
✓ Voicemails will still be received (you can check them once you have a new SIM)

REPLACEMENT SIM OPTIONS:

Option 1 - FASTEST (Same Day):
Visit any of our retail stores with a photo ID and we'll give you a replacement SIM for free. Activate immediately and be back up and running in 10 minutes.

Option 2 - MAIL (2-3 Days):
I can ship you a replacement SIM for free. Standard shipping 2-3 business days, or overnight for $15.

Option 3 - ESIM (If you have compatible device):
If your backup phone supports eSIM, I can provision an eSIM remotely and you'd be active within an hour.

What type of backup phone do you have available?

Also - do you have device protection on your account? If so, you may be able to file a claim for your lost phone.

Waiting to hear from you,
Derek Thompson
Priority Support Team
Case #: URGENT-2024-112601-923

Derek,

Thank you for the fast response! I have an old iPhone 11 I can use. I think it takes a physical SIM card, not eSIM.

There's a store 3 blocks from my office - I can go there at lunch. Will they have this info or do I need to bring anything special?

And yes, I do have device protection! How do I file a claim?

Perfect plan!

FOR THE STORE VISIT:
Just bring a photo ID. I've added notes to your account, so when they look you up, they'll see you need a replacement SIM and can provide it for free. No appointment needed.

FOR DEVICE PROTECTION CLAIM:
1. Go to telecom.com/insurance
2. Click "File a Claim"
3. Select "Lost/Stolen"
4. $99 deductible for a replacement device
5. Replacement ships overnight (usually arrives next day)

What phone did you lose? Depending on the model, you might want to file the claim right away so your replacement arrives quickly.

Also - if you have Find My iPhone enabled, you might still be able to locate it through iCloud.com even though I've suspended service.

Let me know if you need anything else!

Derek

Derek,

Update: Got my SIM at the store (they were super helpful!), my old iPhone is working with my number now.

I checked Find My iPhone and it's showing my phone at the Uber driver's house! I contacted Uber and they're arranging for him to return it. Might get it back tomorrow!

So I'm holding off on the insurance claim for now. If I get my phone back, do I just put the SIM card back in it?

Thanks again for all your help!

Amanda,

That's fantastic news! Yes, if you get your phone back:
1. Just swap the SIM card back into your recovered phone
2. Call or email me and I'll unsuspend that device
3. You're back to normal!

The SIM card works in either device, so you're all set either way.

Fingers crossed you get your phone back!

Derek
