Hi,

I submitted a request to port my number (555-7264) from AT&T to your service 3 days ago. I was told it would take 24-48 hours but it's still not complete. Can you check the status?

I'm worried something went wrong.

Hi Steven,

Thank you for checking in. Let me look up your port status...

PORT REQUEST DETAILS:
- Number: 555-7264
- From: AT&T
- Submitted: November 27, 2024 at 2:15 PM
- Current Status: PENDING - Awaiting info from AT&T

THE ISSUE:
AT&T is requesting additional verification. This happens occasionally when account information doesn't match exactly.

WHAT WE NEED:
The account number you provided (784932) doesn't match AT&T's records for that phone number. Can you double-check your AT&T account number? It's usually on your bill and is 12-15 digits long.

Also verify:
- Account PIN/Password
- Full name on AT&T account
- Billing ZIP code on AT&T account

Once you confirm these details, the port usually completes within 2-4 hours.

Sorry for the delay!

Best,
Carlos Ramirez

Carlos,

I found my AT&T bill - you're right, the account number is different. The correct one is 784932157823.

Account PIN: 4857
Name on account: Steven P. Williams (I might have left out the middle initial before)
ZIP: 90210

Sorry for the confusion!

Steven

Steven,

Perfect! I've updated your port request with the correct information and resubmitted it to AT&T.

NEW TIMELINE:
Port should complete today between 4 PM - 8 PM. When it's done:
1. Your AT&T service will automatically stop
2. Your SIM card with us will activate (might need to restart your phone)
3. You'll receive a text confirmation
4. Your number is fully ported!

I'll monitor this personally and email you once it's complete.

Carlos
