Hello,

I'm traveling to France, Italy, and Spain for 2 weeks in January. I need data and calling while I'm there. What are my options?

I'm on the Unlimited Plus plan.

Hi Daniel,

Great timing to plan ahead! You have several options for staying connected in Europe:

OPTION 1: International Day Pass - $10/day
- Use your phone exactly like at home
- Unlimited calls, texts, data
- Only charged on days you actually use your phone
- 2-week trip max cost: $140

OPTION 2: Monthly International Plan - $70/month
- Unlimited data in 210+ countries
- Unlimited texting
- Calls: $0.25/minute
- Best for trips longer than 7-8 days
- Can cancel after your trip

OPTION 3: Your Current Plan (Unlimited Plus)
- Already includes unlimited texting to/from Europe
- Data: $0.05/MB (very expensive for data - not recommended!)
- Calls: $2.50/minute

OPTION 4: Local European SIM Card
- Cheapest option ($20-40 for 2 weeks)
- Requires unlocked phone
- Different phone number while traveling
- Can be inconvenient

RECOMMENDATION FOR YOUR TRIP:
Monthly International Plan ($70) - Best value for 2 weeks, unlimited data, can use GPS/maps freely, make occasional calls, and cancel when you return.

The Day Pass ($10/day) would cost $140 for your 2-week trip, so the monthly plan saves you $70.

Want me to add the Monthly International Plan to your account? You can add it now and it will be active when you land in Europe.

Bon voyage!

Christina,

The monthly plan sounds perfect! Yes, please add it.

My trip is January 10-24. When should I activate it, and how do I cancel it when I get back?

Daniel

I've added the International Monthly Plan to your account, but I've scheduled it to activate on January 9th (day before your trip). This way you won't pay for December or early January.

IMPORTANT DETAILS:
- Activates: January 9, 2025
- You'll be charged $70 on your January bill
- Works immediately when you land in Europe

TO CANCEL AFTER YOUR TRIP:
- Text "STOP INTL" to 611 from your phone, OR
- Log in to your account online > Manage Add-Ons > Remove International Plan, OR
- Reply to this email and I'll remove it

Best practice: Cancel it on January 25th (day after you return) to avoid being charged for February.

PRO TIPS FOR EUROPE:
1. Turn on "Data Roaming" in your phone settings when you land
2. Restart your phone when you arrive to connect to local networks
3. You can call US numbers and European numbers at the included rate
4. Download offline maps before you go (Google Maps has this feature)

Have an amazing trip!

Christina
