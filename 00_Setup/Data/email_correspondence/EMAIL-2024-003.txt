Subject: Dispute of International Roaming Charges

To whom it may concern,

I received my bill today with $287 in international roaming charges from a trip to Mexico last month. When I signed up for service, I was told my plan included free roaming in Mexico and Canada. These charges don't make sense.

I need this resolved immediately. I should not be charged for roaming that was supposed to be included.

Account: 555-2947
Bill Date: November 15, 2024

Dear David,

Thank you for bringing this to our attention. I apologize for any confusion regarding your Mexico roaming charges. I've thoroughly reviewed your account and have good news.

**Investigation Findings:**
You are correct - your Unlimited Plus plan DOES include talk, text, and data in Mexico and Canada at no extra charge. I reviewed the specific charges and found that:

- $287 in roaming charges were incorrectly applied to your account
- These charges occurred October 12-18, 2024 during your Mexico trip
- The error was due to a system issue that failed to recognize your plan's included Mexico coverage

**Resolution:**
1. All $287 in roaming charges have been REMOVED from your account
2. A credit of $287 has been applied to your account
3. Your correct balance is now $70 (your standard monthly plan charge)
4. I've added a note to your account to prevent this from happening in future trips

I sincerely apologize for this billing error and any stress it caused. Your plan absolutely includes Mexico and Canada coverage, and you should never see roaming charges when visiting those countries.

If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact me directly at this email address.

Thank you for your patience.

Best regards,
Jennifer Wong
