Hi,

I'm a full-time student at Boston University and I saw that you offer a student discount. How much is it and how do I apply?

I'm currently paying $70/month for the Unlimited Plus plan and any savings would really help with my tight budget!

Hi Jordan,

Thanks for reaching out! Yes, we offer a student discount of $10/month for full-time students at accredited universities.

Your current plan: Unlimited Plus at $70/month
With student discount: $60/month
Annual savings: $120

TO APPLY:
1. Visit telecom.com/student-discount
2. Verify your student status through SheerID (secure verification partner)
3. You'll need your .edu email address (which you already have - great!)
4. Upload proof of enrollment (student ID, transcript, or enrollment letter)
5. Approval typically takes 24-48 hours

Once verified, the discount automatically applies to your account and renews each school year (you'll need to reverify annually).

ELIGIBILITY:
✓ Full-time undergraduate or graduate students
✓ Accredited 2-year or 4-year colleges
✓ Community colleges included
✓ Graduate programs included

The discount stays active as long as you're enrolled. When you graduate, you'll have 6 months at the student rate before it returns to standard pricing.

Best,

Michelle,

Perfect! I just completed the verification through SheerID using my BU email and student ID. It says I'm approved and the discount will appear on my next bill.

$120 a year savings is huge for me. Thank you!

Awesome, Jordan! I can confirm the discount is now active on your account.

Your December bill (due Dec 15th) will show the new $60 rate. 

Good luck with finals!

Michelle
