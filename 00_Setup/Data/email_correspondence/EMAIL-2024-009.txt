Hi,

My wife and I each have individual Unlimited Plus plans ($70 each, so $140 total/month). We're thinking about having a baby soon and will eventually want to add a third line.

Do we save money by switching to a family plan now, or should we wait until we actually need the third line?

Thanks,
Michael Johnson

Hi Michael,

Congratulations on planning for a growing family! Great question about timing.

CURRENT COST: $140/month (2 individual lines at $70 each)

IF YOU SWITCH TO FAMILY PLAN NOW:
Unlimited Plus Family (2 lines): $120/month
IMMEDIATE SAVINGS: $20/month ($240/year)

WHEN YOU ADD A 3RD LINE:
Unlimited Plus Family (3 lines): $165/month ($55 per line)
vs. if you waited and added individually: $210/month ($70 x 3)
SAVINGS WITH 3 LINES: $45/month

RECOMMENDATION: Switch to the family plan NOW and start saving immediately. There's no reason to wait - you save $20/month right away, and it makes adding that third line even easier when the time comes.

BONUS: I see you're both eligible for our "Growing Families" promotion:
- Switch to family plan this month → Get $10/month extra discount for 12 months
- That drops your rate to $110/month (saving $30/month!)

Want me to process this switch for you? It takes effect immediately with no service interruption.

Best,

Jennifer,

Yes! Please switch us to the family plan with that promotion. $30/month savings is significant!

Will anything change with our service or phone numbers?

Michael

Done! I've combined both lines into a family account.

WHAT STAYS THE SAME:
✓ Your phone numbers (555-2849 and 555-2850)
✓ Your data, features, everything
✓ Your billing date (still the 15th)

WHAT CHANGES:
✓ One bill instead of two (goes to your email, Michael)
✓ New price: $110/month for 12 months, then $120/month
✓ Combined data usage reporting

Your wife will still have full access to manage her line through her own login. You'll just see both lines when you log into your account.

First combined bill arrives December 15th at the new rate!

Congrats again on your future addition to the family!

Jennifer
