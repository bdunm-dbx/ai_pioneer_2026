URGENT - I just logged into my account and saw that someone changed my account password 2 hours ago. I did NOT make this change. I'm very concerned my account has been hacked.

Please lock my account immediately and help me secure it.

Brian,

Thank you for alerting us immediately. I've taken urgent action to secure your account.

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS TAKEN (3:40 PM):
✓ Account frozen to prevent any changes
✓ Password reset link invalidated
✓ All active login sessions terminated
✓ Account flagged for fraud review
✓ No charges or plan changes detected

SECURITY AUDIT RESULTS:
I reviewed all account activity for the past 7 days:

- Password change: November 27 at 1:18 PM from IP: 192.168.1.45 (Denver, CO)
- Previous login: November 25 at 9:05 AM from IP: 192.168.1.45 (Denver, CO)
- Login before that: November 22 from same IP

QUESTION: Are you in Denver, and is that IP address familiar to you? It's the same IP you've been using for weeks.

Sometimes browsers auto-update passwords or force password resets after security updates. Did you perhaps update your browser or get any password manager notifications recently?

In the meantime, I've sent you a secure password reset link to brian.anderson@email.com. Use that to create a new password you control.

Also enable two-factor authentication to add extra security:
telecom.com/account-security

Please confirm the location and let me know if you recognize that IP address.

Priority response needed,
Ryan Mitchell

Ryan,

Oh man, I feel like an idiot. I just realized - I updated Chrome this morning and it prompted me to update my saved passwords to use stronger ones. I clicked "update all" without really paying attention.

So that WAS me... I'm in Denver and that is my home IP address. I apologize for the panic!

Should I still reset my password and enable 2FA?

Brian,

No need to apologize! Better safe than sorry when it comes to account security. You did exactly the right thing by contacting us immediately.

That Chrome password update explains everything perfectly. Your account is secure.

I've unfrozen your account, and you can use it normally now. 

HOWEVER - I still strongly recommend enabling two-factor authentication! It only takes 2 minutes and provides excellent protection against actual unauthorized access.

To enable 2FA:
1. Log in to telecom.com
2. Account Settings > Security
3. Enable "Two-Factor Authentication"
4. Choose SMS or authenticator app for codes

Stay secure!

Ryan
