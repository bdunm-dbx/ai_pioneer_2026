Agent: Good morning! This is Stephanie. How may I assist you?

Customer: Hi, I'm active duty military and I heard you offer a military discount. How do I get that applied to my account?

Agent: Thank you for your service! Yes, we absolutely offer a military discount. I'd be happy to help you get that set up. Can I get your phone number?

Customer: 555-9137.

Agent: Thank you. Our military discount provides $15 off per month for active duty, veterans, National Guard, and Reserve members, as well as their families. Do you have documentation of your military service available?

Customer: Yes, I have my military ID. What do you need from it?

Agent: I'll need to verify your status through ID.me, which is a secure third-party verification service we use. You can do this online through your account, or I can send you a link via text message right now. Which would you prefer?

Customer: Can you send me the text? That would be easier.

Agent: Absolutely. I'm sending you a text message now with a secure link to ID.me... Sent! You should receive it in just a moment.

Customer: Got it! Should I do this now while you're on the phone?

Agent: Yes, that would be great! I'll stay on the line in case you have any questions.

Customer: Okay, clicking the link... It's asking me to create an ID.me account or sign in. I don't have an account yet.

Agent: No problem, just tap "Create Account" and follow the prompts. You'll need an email address and to create a password.

Customer: Okay, doing that now... Now it's asking me to verify my military status. I can upload a photo of my CAC card, use a military email address, or connect to Defense Department records.

Agent: The military email option is usually fastest if you have a .mil email address. Otherwise, uploading your CAC card photo works great too.

Customer: I'll use my .mil email. Connecting now... It says "Verification Successful! You've been verified as Active Duty Military."

Agent: Perfect! Now it should redirect you back to our website or show you a completion message.

Customer: Yes, it says "Verification Complete. Your military discount has been applied to your account."

Agent: Excellent! I can see on my end that the discount has been added. Your $15 monthly military discount will start with your next billing cycle on December 20th. Your monthly bill will go from $70 to $55.

Customer: That's amazing! Does this discount stay forever?

Agent: As long as you maintain eligible military status, yes! We verify status annually through ID.me, so you'll get a reminder email each year to re-verify. It's a quick process and ensures the discount continues.

Customer: That's fantastic. One more question - does this discount apply to family plans too?

Agent: Yes! If you have a family plan, the $15 discount applies to the entire account, not just one line. So you'd see even more savings if you add lines in the future.

Customer: Perfect! Thank you so much for your help, Stephanie.

Agent: You're very welcome, and thank you again for your service! Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, that's everything. Thanks!

Agent: Have a wonderful day!
