TRANSCRIPT:

Agent: Good afternoon, this is Christine. How may I help you today?

Customer: Hello dear, this is Margaret. I'm 78 years old and I'm having trouble with my phone. My grandson set it up for me, but I can't figure out how to make calls. The screen keeps changing and I don't know what I'm doing.

Agent: Hi Margaret, I'm so glad you called. Don't worry, we'll get this sorted out together. I'll go slowly and make sure you understand each step. What type of phone do you have?

Customer: It's an iPhone. My grandson said it's an iPhone 11. It has a purple case.

Agent: Perfect! iPhones are very user-friendly once you get the hang of them. Let's start with making a phone call. First, is your phone turned on right now? Can you see anything on the screen?

Customer: Yes, it's on. I see the time and a picture of my grandchildren.

Agent: Wonderful! That's your lock screen. To use your phone, you need to unlock it first. Do you see a small line or bar at the bottom of the screen?

Customer: Yes, I see a white line at the very bottom.

Agent: Great! Put your finger on that line and swipe up - like you're flicking something up off the screen.

Customer: Oh my! The screen changed. Now I see lots of little square pictures.

Agent: Perfect! Those little squares are called apps. Each one does something different. To make a phone call, look for a green square with a white phone icon on it. It should say "Phone" underneath. Do you see it?

Customer: Let me look... Yes! I found it. It's green with a little phone picture.

Agent: Excellent! Now tap on that green square once with your finger.

Customer: Oh! Now I see a bunch of numbers, like a telephone keypad!

Agent: Perfect! That's exactly what you want. Now you can dial a phone number just like you would on an old telephone. Try calling someone you know - maybe dial your home number or your grandson's number.

Customer: Okay, I'm dialing my home number... Oh, I can hear it ringing! It's working! Let me hang up before my answering machine picks up.

Agent: To hang up, do you see a red button at the bottom of the screen?

Customer: Yes, it says "End" and it's red.

Agent: Tap that to hang up.

Customer: Done! Oh my goodness, I did it! That was so easy!

Agent: You did great, Margaret! Now, let me show you an even easier way to make calls. Hang up if you haven't already, and let's go back to the Phone app - tap that green Phone square again.

Customer: Okay, I'm back in the Phone app.

Agent: At the bottom of the screen, do you see some words in a row? One should say "Contacts."

Customer: Yes, I see Contacts, Recents, and some other words.

Agent: Perfect! Tap on "Contacts." This is where you can save phone numbers for people you call often. Has your grandson added any contacts for you?

Customer: Oh! I see names here! I see my grandson Tyler, my daughter Susan, and some others!

Agent: Wonderful! So instead of remembering phone numbers, you can just tap on someone's name in your Contacts and it will call them automatically. Try tapping on one of those names.

Customer: I'll tap on Tyler... Oh! It's showing his phone number and a green button that says "Call."

Agent: Exactly! If you tap that green "Call" button, it would call Tyler. You can also tap on his name again to see more information. The contacts list is the easiest way to call people.

Customer: This is so much better than remembering all those numbers! Christine, you're an angel. This makes so much more sense now.

Agent: You're very welcome, Margaret! You're doing wonderfully. Now, let me give you one more tip. If your phone rings and someone is calling you, you'll see a green button that says "Accept" and a red button that says "Decline." Green to answer, red to ignore the call.

Customer: Green for yes, red for no. I can remember that!

Agent: Perfect! Now, do you have a pen and paper handy?

Customer: Yes, just a moment... Okay, I have it.

Agent: Write down our customer service number: 1-800-555-0100. If you ever have trouble with your phone or your service, you can call that number anytime, and someone like me will help you.

Customer: 1-800-555-0100. I'm writing it on a sticky note to put on my refrigerator.

Agent: That's perfect! Is there anything else about your phone that's confusing you?

Customer: No dear, you've been so helpful. I feel much better about using this phone now. Thank you so much for your patience.

Agent: It was truly my pleasure, Margaret. You did an excellent job learning today. Don't hesitate to call us if you need help with anything else.

Customer: Thank you, Christine. You have a lovely day!

Agent: You too, Margaret! Goodbye!
