FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
---

Q: Do I need a new phone for 5G?
A: Yes, 5G requires a 5G-compatible device. Most phones from 2020 and newer support 5G.

Q: Will 5G work everywhere?
A: 5G is available in 94% of our coverage area. In areas without 5G, your phone automatically uses 4G LTE.

Q: Does 5G drain battery faster?
A: Modern 5G phones are optimized for battery efficiency. You may see 10-15% more battery use with constant 5G, but normal use patterns show minimal impact.

Q: Is 5G safe?
A: Yes. 5G operates within FCC safety guidelines and uses non-ionizing radio frequencies, similar to 4G and Wi-Fi.

Q: Do I pay extra for 5G?
A: No. 5G access is included with all our Unlimited plans at no additional cost.
